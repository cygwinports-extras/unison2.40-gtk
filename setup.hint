sdesc: "Unison file syncronizer with GTK+ interface (2.27 branch)"
ldesc: "Unison is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and Windows. It 
allows two replicas of a collection of files and directories to be 
stored on different hosts (or different disks on the same host), 
modified separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the 
changes in each replica to the other."
